## Coding Exercise - Build a Music Library

Create an application that allows a user to manage their songs. User should be able to...
● Display their songs
● Sort by album name, song title, and other useful attributes
● Search by song title (bonus points for other search criteria)
Include all the assets necessary for someone to use and understand your application. A link to your github repo is the best way to deliver the source.
Parameters
The goal of the exercise is to demonstrate how you develop and deliver software: The approach you use, the tradeoffs you make, the tools you employ, the quality and style of the code you write, and the assets you deliver. It's purposely open-ended to allow you to explore the problem space and choose the areas you want to focus on.
Don't spend more than 6 hours on the exercise. This is a guideline to save you time and sanity, not a hard limit.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project

```
